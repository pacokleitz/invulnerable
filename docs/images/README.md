# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots and images for the documentation.

## Adding Screenshots

To add a screenshot:

1. Take a screenshot of the application
2. Save it with a descriptive name (e.g., `dashboard-screenshot.png`, `vulnerabilities-page.png`)
3. Add it to this directory
4. Reference it in the README or documentation using:
   ```markdown
   ![Description](docs/images/filename.png)
   ```

## Current Screenshots

- `dashboard-screenshot.png` - Main dashboard view (placeholder - needs to be added)

## Image Guidelines

- Use PNG format for screenshots
- Keep file sizes reasonable (compress if needed)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include the full application view when possible
- Ensure no sensitive information is visible
